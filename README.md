# TestGASUE4 - made in UE4.25

 UE4 Gameplay Ability System -- with custom MMORPG-Style character movement
 
 Designed with intent for multiplayer development
 
 # BEWARE: there are a lot of large comments as this was my first attempt at creating a project that uses the GAS and has multiplayer functionality
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 GAS -- https://github.com/Pantong51/GASContent/blob/master/README.md\
 
 Dan's GAS example (STRONG REFERENCE... copy pasted a lot of info from here as comments to remember important info) -- https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation
 
 ^ this reference provides a lot of boilerplate code and I used a lot of it myself... most of the boilerplate code is creating and attaching the GAS components such as the AbilitySystemComponent and AttributeSet

 Move with either WASD or by holding both mouse buttons down --> See the TGCharacterExample in Character/Heroes
 
 Currently, source has 3 attributes -> MoveSpeed which is used to override our Character Movement Component
 others are WIP
 
 Targeting is WIP
